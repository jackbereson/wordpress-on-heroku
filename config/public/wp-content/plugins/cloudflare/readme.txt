The CloudFlare WordPress Plugin ensures your WordPress blog is running optimally on the CloudFlare platform.

== Description ==

CloudFlare has developed a plugin for WordPress. By using the CloudFlare WordPress Plugin, you receive: 

* Correct IP Address information for comments posted to your site

* Better protection as spammers from your WordPress blog get reported to CloudFlare

THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW:

* The main purpose of this plugin is to ensure you have no change to your originating IPs when using CloudFlare. Since CloudFlare acts a reverse proxy, connecting IPs now come from CloudFlare's range. This plugin will ensure you can continue to see the originating IP. 

* Every time you click the 'spam' button on your blog, this threat information is sent to CloudFlare to ensure you are constantly getting the best site protection.

* We recommend that any user on WordPress and CloudFlare should use this plugin. 

MORE INFORMATION ON CLOUDFLARE:

CloudFlare is a service that makes websites load faster and protects sites from online spammers and hackers. Any website with a root domain (ie www.mydomain.com) can use CloudFlare. On average, it takes less than 5 minutes to sign up. You can learn more here: [CloudFlare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/overview.html).

== Installation ==

Upload the CloudFlare plugin to your blog, Activate it, and you're done!
